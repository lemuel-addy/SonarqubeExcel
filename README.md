# SonarqubeExcel
A program that transfers CSV file data with Sonarqube scores to an Excel sheet at the specified parameters 

# How it works
This C# code reads data from a CSV file and copies it into a specific Excel worksheet by using a process similar to Web Scraping:

1. **Automation**:
   - The code automates the process of reading data from a CSV file and writing it into an Excel worksheet.
   - It utilizes libraries to handle Excel files, automate file handling, and manage worksheet interactions.

2. **Customization**:
   - The code can be customized to handle different CSV formats and adapt to various Excel file structures.
   - The script can be modified to process data according to specific requirements, adjusting the logic to match the intended behavior.

3. **Large-Scale Data Collection**:
   - It can be adapted to handle a large number of rows or multiple CSV files.
   - By extending the logic, it can process large datasets efficiently and write the data into the appropriate Excel cells.

4. **Integration and Analysis**:
   - The script can be integrated into a larger application or workflow, allowing the seamless processing of data from CSV to Excel.
   - This then enables further analysis, reporting, or visualization, enabling data-driven decision-making.
